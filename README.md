# Floating Five Game
A different take on the Five on a Row game. Written in Python using Pygame.

This game takes place on in infinitely large grid where a human player and PC oppoponent take turns to fill out squares with the goal of achieving 5 on a row.
The PC opponent is implemented with an relative simple route, which ranks possible moves after which will be most efficient in tampering the human player while advancing its own play. Personally, I find the PC opponent surprisingly hard to beat, despite not using any type of AI/machine learning.
